Q1: CNN

[1] Lines 46 and 50 represent the convolutional layers. For part (c) where there are 3 Convolutional layers, another of the same code is added
[2] Parameters are numbered from 1 through 12. These can be changed accordingly to get the best classification accuracy


Q2: SAAK

(I) For the given number of components to keep in each stage:(1536) 
Use the following codes only.
	mnist.py
	util.py
	voc12.py
	model.py
(II) For operating for 2048 parameters:
Additionally use

	SAAK_PCA.py 
		for further feature reduction and computing the classification accuracy
